## Overview

This project analysis dataset is from [Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses/code) to find the probable cause in aviation business.<br /> The most equitable actions can be taken to produce quality analysis for a start-up business like Jet Flight by looking at historical data.

## Data Understanding

The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents globally.<br />The dataset is comprises of **31 columns** and **88,889 entries**. However, even with so much information, the dataset contains more than 30% of missing<br /> values and syntax errors.

We believe that the "success" of aviation business can be measured by use of quality aircraft, by considering make and model less involved in accidents<br />
and also the aviation service you consider venturing in

Note: The **Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023** dataset is provided zipped in our data folder and needs to be unzipped for data analysis.

## Insights

This project uses descriptive analysis in several forms to attempt to understand major success indicators the aviation industry to identify<br /> potentially useful strategies for producing a successful business.

### Findings

**Aircraft Make**

Some aircraft make has high probability of being involved in an accident than others. Cessna and Piper have recorded high <br /> accident rate as viewed from the dataset.

**Weather condition**

Weather is a very sensitive condition that should be highly considered when venturing into aviation indurstry.<br />
From our analysis, VMC is the most dangerous weather condition thus no airplane should be allowed to operate. IMC and UNK should also not be ignored <br /> and the aircraft work team must be very keen during operations.

**Purpose_of_flight**

Jet Flight being a start-up company should consider venturing into services that are not prone to high risks.<br />
Aircraft Services like 'Personal', 'Instructional', 'Aerial Application' should not be offered by a start-up business like Jet Flight. They <br />
should consider Services like 'Public Aircraft', either offer it locally or globally because it has recorded a low risk to accidents
